# sudoku-solver

Solves a valid sudoku (a sudoku board that has a single solution)

## Input

The input is a 9x9 matrix of integers. The empty cells are represented by 0 in the Python file.
Known cells are inputted into relevant text fields, and empty cells are left blank in the JavaScript version.

## Output

Outputs the sudoku board with all the cells filled in such that a solution is given. In the JavaScript version, the cells that were inputted are coloured in, while those solved for are white to show the user which ones were originally there after the board has been filled.
